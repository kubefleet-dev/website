#### AppliedWork



AppliedWork represents an applied work on managed cluster that is placed
on a managed cluster. An appliedwork links to a work on a hub recording resources
deployed in the managed cluster.
When the agent is removed from managed cluster, cluster-admin on managed cluster
can delete appliedwork to remove resources deployed by the agent.
The name of the appliedwork must be the same as {work name}
The namespace of the appliedwork should be the same as the resource applied on
the managed cluster.

ClusterResourcePlacement is used to select cluster scoped resources, including built-in resources and custom resources,
and placement them onto selected member clusters in a fleet.


If a namespace is selected, ALL the resources under the namespace are placed to the target clusters.
Note that you can't select the following resources:

    fleet-* (reserved for fleet system namespaces).
  - reserved fleet resource types including: MemberCluster, InternalMemberCluster, ClusterResourcePlacement,
    ClusterSchedulingPolicySnapshot, ClusterResourceSnapshot, ClusterResourceBinding, etc.


`ClusterSchedulingPolicySnapshot` and `ClusterResourceSnapshot` objects are created when there are changes in the
system to keep the history of the changes affecting a `ClusterResourcePlacement`.

#### ClusterResourceSnapshot



ClusterResourceSnapshot is used to store a snapshot of selected resources by a resource placement policy.
Its spec is immutable.
We may need to produce more than one resourceSnapshot for all the resources a ResourcePlacement selected to get around the 1MB size limit of k8s objects.
We assign an ever-increasing index for each such group of resourceSnapshots.
The naming convention of a clusterResourceSnapshot is {CRPName}-{resourceIndex}-{subindex}
where the name of the first snapshot of a group has no subindex part so its name is {CRPName}-{resourceIndex}-snapshot.
resourceIndex will begin with 0.
Each snapshot MUST have the following labels:
  - `CRPTrackingLabel` which points to its owner CRP.
  - `ResourceIndexLabel` which is the index  of the snapshot group.
  - `IsLatestSnapshotLabel` which indicates whether the snapshot is the latest one.


All the snapshots within the same index group must have the same ResourceIndexLabel.


The first snapshot of the index group MUST have the following annotations:
  - `NumberOfResourceSnapshotsAnnotation` to store the total number of resource snapshots in the index group.
  - `ResourceGroupHashAnnotation` whose value is the sha-256 hash of all the snapshots belong to the same snapshot index.


Each snapshot (excluding the first snapshot) MUST have the following annotations:
  - `SubindexOfResourceSnapshotAnnotation` to store the subindex of resource snapshot in the group.
